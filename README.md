BeamNGpy is an official library providing a Python interface to BeamNG.research, the research-oriented fork of the video game BeamNG.drive.

It allows remote control of the simulation, including vehicles contained in it:

Vehicles and the environment can be equipped with various sensors that provide simulated sensor data such as a camera feed, with options for depth values and pixel-perfect semantic annotation:
