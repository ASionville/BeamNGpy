BeamNG ROS Integration
======================

To support the interoperability between BeamNG.tech and ROS we published the BeamNG ROS Integration.
It is an independent ROS package that translates a range of BeamNGpy features to the ROS framework.
Its full documentation can be found `here <https://beamngpy.readthedocs.io/projects/bng_ros_integration/en/latest/>`_.
